# Hermit-Crab-Simulator

This is a project I created while at UCI. Instructions for the game are included in it.

To play the game, simply open the executable file for your OS 
("Hermit Crab Simulator" for Mac and "HermitCrabSimWin" for Windows).

Feedback is welcome, I don't imagine I'll be adding much to this in the future but I would love to hear what you think.

You can also visit my website at ethandsanchez.com to see more projects I've worked on.
